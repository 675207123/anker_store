The Power User Program was created so we can more directly engage with users to learn how we can do better. Particularly for our new release products, we offer a limited supply of free test samples in exchange for early feedback. This feedback helps us better gauge market response and get a head start on any areas that might need improvement. We also encourage Power Users to share their reviews publicly to help inform prospective buyers about what they can expect from new Anker products. </p>
      <p>Power Users are individuals who not only appreciate free products, they are pioneers who enjoy testing, sharing helpful suggestions to our product, marketing, and customer service teams. They also enjoy sharing their experiences with other prospective buyers.</p>"

Selections will vary to reflect our product focus, but Power Users may choose according to their own interest – there is no obligation to receive or review an undesired product. </p>
      <p>Power Users also receive regular exclusive discounts on Anker products. </p>
      <p>Power Users will occasionally have the opportunity to get bonus gifts after helping us complete surveys.</p>"

If circumstances prevent a Power User from providing timely feedback, they are expected to provide advanced notice. Otherwise, delayed feedback may impact eligibility to apply for future Anker products. </p>
      <p>Power Users are expected to help us by completing surveys that help us improve our products and brand image. </p>
      <p>If in need of assistance during the testing, Power Users are encouraged to contact our customer support team (<a href=\"mailto:support@anker.com\">support@anker.com</a>) directly.</p>
